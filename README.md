#MassiveCore Forge Fixes
This simple plugin fixes game-breaking issues with Forge and MassiveCore.

##Downloading & Installation 
You can download MassiveCore Forge Fixes from the releases section:
https://github.com/MarkehMe/MassiveCoreForgeFixes/releases

To install, simply place in your plugins folder, along with the latest version of MassiveCore and your other MassiveCraft plugins. Always use the latest versions! 

##What it doesn't fix
### ! ParticleEffect Library error codes
This is because your Bukkit version is out of date with the latest version of Minecraft. This bug is not game-breaking, and should simply be ignored.

### ! Double "Wilderness --> Faction" message
I am unaware of what is causing this currently, however it is not game-breaking, and should be ignored for now.
